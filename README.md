# Edureka---Machine-Learning---Module-2
Questions:
1.Load the data from “cere
al
.csv” and plot 
histograms of sugar and vitamin content 
across different cereals.
[Hint: Extract values of a specific column using their labels and use hist method of 
pyplot
]
2. The names of the manufactures are coded using alphabets, create a new column 
with their full
name using the below mapping.
'N': 'Nabisco',
'Q': 'Quaker Oats',
'K': 'Kelloggs',
'R': 'Raslston Purina',
'G': 'General Mills' ,
'P' :'Post' ,
'A':'American Home Foods Products'
Create a bar plot where each manufacturer is on the y axis and the h
eight of the bars 
depict the number of cereals manufactured by them.
[Hint: Try using countplot this time or bar method of pyplot]
3. Extract the rating as your target variable ‘y’ and all numerical parameters as your 
predictors ‘x’. Separate 25% of your 
data as test set.
4. Fit a linear regression module and measure the mean squared error on test 
dataset.
[ Hint: Explore linear models and metrics section of sklearn 
documentation]
